- Get familiar with the code - use it!
- Go through the vignettes
- Read the helpfiles
- Use the code (again)

- Keep notes: questions, unexpected behaviour
- Talk to the maintainer often, clarifying questions

# You can smell without doing the cooking

--

Code Smells (I first heard through [Jenny Bryan's UseR 2018 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyiPBjLAWY&t=4s)):

> is an evocative term for that vague feeling of unease we get when reading certain bits of code. It's not necessarily wrong, but neither is it obviously correct

--

- You can identify code patterns and smells even without deeply understanding the code

---

# You can smell without doing the cooking

- Identifying repeated error messages
- Re-wording error messages

    params,

# Use snapshot tests

You want to test messages or output, e.g., that your code looks like this:

```
> 
greta array (data)

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    4    7
[2,]    2    5    8
[3,]    3    6    9
```

---
# Use snapshot tests: before

```r
# data arrays
# print method
ga_data <- as_data(matrix(1:9, nrow = 3))
expected_output <- paste0(
  "greta array (data)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]",
  "    1    4    7\n[2,]    2    5    8\n[3,]    3",
  "    6    9")
result <- evaluate_promise(ga_data, print = TRUE)
expect_identical(result$output, expected_output)
```


---
# Snapshot tests: after

```r
# data arrays
# print method
ga_data <- as_data(matrix(1:9, nrow = 3))
expect_snapshot(
  ga_data
)
```

---
# Snapshot test

```
# print and summary work

    Code
      ga_data
    Output
      greta array (data)
      
           [,1] [,2] [,3]
      [1,]    1    4    7
      [2,]    2    5    8
      [3,]    3    6    9
```

---
# Snapshot tests: error message testing before

```r
# wrong class of object
expect_error(
  as_data(NULL),
  "objects of class NULL cannot be coerced to greta arrays"
  )
expect_error(
  as_data(list()),
  "objects of class list cannot be coerced to greta arrays"
  )
expect_error(
  as_data(environment()),
  "objects of class environment cannot be coerced to greta arrays"
  )
```

---
# Snapshot tests: error message testing after

```r
# wrong class of object
expect_snapshot_error(
  as_data(NULL)
)

expect_snapshot_error(
  as_data(list())
)

expect_snapshot_error(
  as_data(environment())
)
```

---
# Snapshot tests: error messages output

```
# as_data errors informatively

    Object cannot be coerced to <greta_array>
    Objects of class <NULL> cannot be coerced to a <greta_array>

---

    Object cannot be coerced to <greta_array>
    Objects of class <list> cannot be coerced to a <greta_array>

---

    Object cannot be coerced to <greta_array>
    Objects of class <environment> cannot be coerced to a <greta_array>

---
```

???

- Also provides a useful way to review all error messages - you can read over error/warning/messages in bulk
- E.g., change from:
  - "Error: Wrong dimensions for X" to 
  - "Error: Dimensions for X must be Z, but we see X has dimensions Y"

---
# Use Version Control

- Git/mercurial/SVN/whatever

--

- github/bitbucket/gitlab/whatever

--

- If you develop a new changes, make a new branch. 
- The minor convenience is worth the relief. 

???

- The relief of making changes to the code, making a bunch of mistakes, realising it would break a lot of things downstream and that you can safely leave it be and it will not ruin your code. It is very satisfying.

# Write useful commit messages

Do:

- Finish the sentence: "This commit will..."*
- "This commit will use message instead of stop"

Don't

- "No hyphen, ugh"
- "uhhhh, try putting dev mockery back?"

`*` heard from [Adam Gruer](https://twitter.com/AdamGruer)

---

# Save time with `pr_fetch()` and `pr_finish()`

These are amazing functions that help save me a bit of time every day

- `pr_fetch(101)`: Grabs Pull Request 101 from github into your local session
- `pr_finish(101)`: After you've merged your PR on github, deletes the branch locally and remotely, makes sure you are back on main branch
- There are more (which I should probably learn) see the [usethis docs](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/pull-requests.html)

---
# Continuous integration: it will save you time

- Run your code on someone else's (GitHub's) machine
- Run your tests - check things work

---
# Continuous integration: it will save you time...eventually

```{r show-ghactions, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/gh-actions-wait.png")
```

---
# ....Eventually

- Sometimes it feels like you'll be doing a lot of waiting

--

- Push...wait 23 minutes for it to finish building on Windows

--

- Push...google some obscure error message

--

- Realise you have specified `shell: RScript {0}` instead of `shell: Rscript {0}`
 (there is an upper case `S` in the first one. Thank you Jim Hester for finding this)

--

- Realise you have spent several days debugging some issue with GH actions that was actually just some missing `{`


---
# ....Eventually

- I feel like I spent 90% of last year trying to get GH actions passing

--

- I really wish I had learnt a bit about it before blindly pushing changes - e.g., that you can run actions locally

--

- Some sample commit messages:

- "Try windows old-rel instead of 3.6"
- "No hyphen, ugh"
- "use oldrel-1 and oldrel-2 instead of oldrel and R 3.5"
- "ugh, mockery was there twice. Try removing the dev versions again?"
- "uhhhh, try putting dev mockery back?"
- "what happens on CI if we don't use mockery dev?"

---
# ... Eventually - the "always failing" paradox

- If your tests fail, does your software actually work?

--

- A single test failure doesn't mean it is broken!

--

- `greta` stay in a place of "it isn't any _more_ broken than before..."

--

- Slightly brain melting: trying to diff error messages and mentally regression test them. Not what it is designed for.

--

- Waiting 1-24 minutes for a build to finish can be a massive time suck.

---

# Use **repr**oducible **ex**amples

.large[
- Wrap up small problems into small examples with `reprex`
- The act of reprexing has solved many problems for me!
- It helps others solve your problem as well
- A "video reprex" can also be useful/better. (e.g., demo spooky browser behaviour)

## Prefer glue over paste/sprintf

```{r glue, echo = TRUE}
dist_type <- "normal"
n_dim <- 6
paste0("Following a ", dist_type, " distribution with ", n_dim, " dimensions")
```

--

```{r show-glue, echo = TRUE}
glue("Following a {dist_type} distribution with {n_dim} dimensions")
```

## Use cli to construct messages: good

```{r cli-show-paste-fun, echo = TRUE}
print_file_msg_paste <- function(n_file){
  msg <- ifelse(test = n_file == 1,
                yes = paste0("Found ", n_file, " file"),
                no = paste0("Found ", n_file, " files"))
  cat(msg)
}
```

---

## Use cli to construct messages: good

```{r cli-show-paste, echo = TRUE}
print_file_msg_paste(0)
print_file_msg_paste(1)
print_file_msg_paste(2)
```

---

## Use cli to construct messages: better

```{r cli-show-cli, echo = TRUE}
print_file_msg_cli <- function(n_file){
  cat(format_message("Found {n_file} file{?s}"))
}
```

---

## Use cli to construct messages: better

```{r cli-show-cli-print, echo = TRUE}
print_file_msg_cli(1)
print_file_msg_cli(2)
print_file_msg_cli(3)
```

# R Packages aren't always the answer

- Not everything needs to be an R package
- Sometimes analysis code isn't always appropriate to change to package code.

## RSEs and software are starting to get more credit

In the past 12 months:


- [Nature article: Why science needs more research software engineers](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01516-2), by [Chris Woolston](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_sauthors=%22Chris%2BWoolston%22)
- Monash University Business School now recognises software as first class academic output
- Statistical Society of Australia (SSA) hosted a panel session on RSEs
- ACEMs podcast: acknowledging research software
- I delivered seminar: ["Acknowledging research software in academia"]() at UNSW
- SSA has developed two awards for statistical software:
  - Di Cook Award ($1000): Student prize for Victoria and Tasmania
  - Venables Award ($5000): National statistical software prize
