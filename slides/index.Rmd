# Getting to grips with a new code base

- Keep a notebook
- Get familiar with the code - use it!
- Go through the vignettes
- Read the helpfiles
- Use the code (again)
- Read the vignettes (again)
- Keep notes: questions, unexpected behaviour
- Talk to the maintainer often, clarifying questions

# You can smell without doing the cooking

Code Smells (first heard through [Jenny Bryan's UseR 2018 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyiPBjLAWY&t=4s)):

> is an evocative term for that vague feeling of unease we get when reading certain bits of code. It's not necessarily wrong, but neither is it obviously correct


--

- You can identify code patterns and smells even without deeply understanding the code

---

# You can smell without doing the cooking

- Reading over code, you can lack the deep understanding you might want, but can still contribute useful abstractions, identify repeated code.
- For example:
  - identifying repeated error messages
  - Re-wording error messages

```r
param_lengths <- vapply(params,
        function(x) length(x),

# Use snapshot tests

You want to test messages or output, e.g., that your code looks like this:

```
> 
greta array (data)

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    4    7
[2,]    2    5    8
[3,]    3    6    9
```

---
# Use snapshot tests: before

```r
# data arrays
# print method
ga_data <- as_data(matrix(1:9, nrow = 3))
expected_output <- paste0(
  "greta array (data)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]",
  "    1    4    7\n[2,]    2    5    8\n[3,]    3",
  "    6    9")
result <- evaluate_promise(ga_data, print = TRUE)
expect_identical(result$output, expected_output)
```


---
# Snapshot tests: after

```r
# data arrays
# print method
ga_data <- as_data(matrix(1:9, nrow = 3))
expect_snapshot(
  ga_data
)
```

---
# Snapshot test

```
# print and summary work

    Code
      ga_data
    Output
      greta array (data)
      
           [,1] [,2] [,3]
      [1,]    1    4    7
      [2,]    2    5    8
      [3,]    3    6    9
```

---
# Snapshot tests  - error message testing before: 

```r
# wrong class of object
expect_error(
  as_data(NULL),
  "objects of class NULL cannot be coerced to greta arrays"
  )
expect_error(
  as_data(list()),
  "objects of class list cannot be coerced to greta arrays"
  )
expect_error(
  as_data(environment()),
  "objects of class environment cannot be coerced to greta arrays"
  )
```

---
# Snapshot tests  - error message testing after

```r
# wrong class of object
expect_snapshot_error(
  as_data(NULL)
)

expect_snapshot_error(
  as_data(list())
)

expect_snapshot_error(
  as_data(environment())
)
```

---
# Snapshot tests  - error messages output

```
# as_data errors informatively

    Object cannot be coerced to <greta_array>
    Objects of class <NULL> cannot be coerced to a <greta_array>

---

    Object cannot be coerced to <greta_array>
    Objects of class <list> cannot be coerced to a <greta_array>

---

    Object cannot be coerced to <greta_array>
    Objects of class <environment> cannot be coerced to a <greta_array>

---
```

???

- Also provides a useful way to review all error messages - you can read over error/warning/messages in bulk
- E.g., change from:
  - "Error: Wrong dimensions for X" to 
  - "Error: Dimensions for X must be Z, but we see X has dimensions Y"

---
# Use Version Control

- Git/mercurial/SVN/whatever

--

- github/bitbucket/gitlab/whatever

--

- Develop new changes in new branches. The minor convenience is worth the relief. 

???

- The relief of making changes to the code, making a bunch of mistakes, realising it would break a lot of things downstream and that you can safely leave it be and it will not ruin your code. It is very satisfying.


---

# Write useful commit messages

Do:

- "This commit will..."*
- "This commit will use message instead of stop"

Don't

- "No hyphen, ugh"
- "uhhhh, try putting dev mockery back?"

`*` heard from [Adam Gruer](https://twitter.com/AdamGruer)

# Save time with `pr_fetch()` and `pr_finish()`

These are amazing functions that help save me a bit of time every day

- `pr_fetch(101)`: Grabs Pull Request 101 from github into your local session
- `pr_finish(101)`: After you've merged your PR on github, deletes the branch locally and remotely, makes sure you are back on main branch
- There are more, which I should probably learn - see the [usethis docs](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#pull-requests)

---
# Continuous integration: it will save you time

- Run your code on someone else's (GitHub's) machine
- Run your tests - check things work

---
# Continuous integration: it will save you time...eventually

```{r show-ghactions, out.width = "200%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/gh-actions-wait.png")
```

---
# ....Eventually

- Sometimes it feels like you'll be doing a lot of waiting

--

- Push...wait 23 minutes for it to finish building on Windows

--

- Push...google some obscure error message

--

- Realise you have specified `shell: RScript {0}` instead of `shell: Rscript {0}`
 (there is an upper case `S` in the first one. Thank you Jim Hester for finding this)

--

- Realise you have spent several days debugging some issue with GH actions that was actually just some missing `{` in `$secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`


---
# ....Eventually

- I feel like I spent 90% of my time trying to get green lights on GH actions

--

- Learn a bit about it before blindly pushing changes

--

- Some sample commit messages:

- "Try windows old-rel instead of 3.6"
- "No hyphen, ugh"
- "use oldrel-1 and oldrel-2 instead of oldrel and R 3.5"
- "ugh, mockery was there twice. Let's try removing the dev versions again"
- "uhhhh, try putting dev mockery back?"
- "what happens on CI if we don't use mockery dev?"

???

- Creates an interesting problem. If you can't get the builds to work, do you even know if your software works? For a long time, greta was in a place of "it isn't any _more_ broken than before, so this push is fine". But that took a cumulative toll on my poor brain, trying to diff error messages and mentally regression test them. Literally not what it is designed for.
- Also, waiting 1-24 minutes for a build to finish can be a massive time suck. Chasing the wrong error messages on gh actions is also a great one. Some of my favourites:

---

# Use **repr**oducible **ex**amples

- Wrap up small problems into small examples with `reprex`
- The act of reprexing has solved many problems for me!
- It helps others solve your problem as well

--

- A "video reprex" can also be useful/better. 
- E.g., demonstrate strange/spooky behaviour with a debugger with `browser()`

---

## use glue over paste/sprintf

```{r glue, echo = TRUE}
dist_type <- "normal"
n_dim <- 6
paste0("Following a ", dist_type, " distribution with ", n_dim, "dimensions")
```

- `glue` only imports `methods`, is plenty fast for majority of uses

```{r show-glue, echo = TRUE}
glue("Following a {dist_type} distribution with {n_dim} dimensions")
```


See my blog post, ["glue magic Part 1"](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2019/07/07/glue-magic-p1/)

## Use cli to construct messages: good

```{r cli-show-paste-fun, echo = TRUE}
print_file_msg_paste <- function(n_file){
  msg <- ifelse(test = n_file == 1,
                yes = paste0("Found ", n_file, " file"),
                no = paste0("Found ", n_file, " files"))
  cat(msg)
}
```

---

## Use cli to construct messages: good

```{r cli-show-paste, echo = TRUE}
print_file_msg_paste(0)
print_file_msg_paste(1)
print_file_msg_paste(2)
```

---

## Use cli to construct messages: better

```{r cli-show-cli, echo = TRUE}
print_file_msg_cli <- function(n_file){
  cat(format_message("Found {n_file} file{?s}"))
}
```

---

## Use cli to construct messages: better

```{r cli-show-cli-print, echo = TRUE}
print_file_msg_cli(1)
print_file_msg_cli(2)
print_file_msg_cli(3)
```

# R Packages aren't always the answer

- Not everything needs to be an R package
- Sometimes analysis code isn't always appropriate to change to package code. 
See [Miles McBain's](https://twitter.com/MilesMcBain) blog post ["Project as an R package: An okay idea"](https://www.milesmcbain.com/posts/an-okay-idea/) on this.

- Monash University Business School now recognises software as first class academic output
- Statistical Society of Australia (SSA) hosted a panel session on RSEs
- Bioinformatics panel session on research software
- ACEMs podcast: acknowledging research software
- I delievered seminar: "acknowledging research software" at UNSW
- SSA has the Di Cook Award (\\$1000): student statistical software prize for Victoria and Tasmania -
- SSA has the Venables Award (\\$5000) national statistical software prize

Cutting room floor: things that probably won't make it into the talk

???

Use markdown roxygen
Convert with `roxygen2md::roxygen2md()`

Some places I spent more time (than I ever thought was possible)

1. Getting Github actions to green light
2. Implementing style changes

```{r meme-create, eval = FALSE}
meme_get("SuezExcavator") %>%
  meme_text_suez(
    evergiven = "11,400 lines of code",
    excavator = "Reading each source file in alphabetical order",
    size = 35
  ) %>% 
  image_resize(geometry = "200%") %>% 
  image_write("suez.png")

```

Some more topics for reflection

???

 - Transfer package builds over to GitHub Actions
 - Develop helper functions for easy installation of TensorFlow + Python
 - Use snapshot testing to better capture messages
 - Convert roxygen to use markdown
 - Implement tidyverse style
 - Review error messages
 - use glue over paste/sprintf to construct messages

Develop helper functions for easy installation of TensorFlow + Python

A snapshot of some fun daily tasks as an RSE

Python no longer detected?
  - Latest RStudio doesn't detect Python
  - File issue with RStudio
  - Identify fix with an environment variable

Examples of daily tasks: with {greta}

RStudio Tensorflow package has updated
  - `dim()` now returns vector not list
  - Completely breaks greta
  - (This happens just as we are teaching a course)
  - Solution: have two versions of greta, one docker container, one local
  - Browse into errored parts of the code in each version
